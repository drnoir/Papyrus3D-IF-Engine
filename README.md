## Papyrus 3D - Interactive Fiction Engine by Chris Godber
##### Current Version: 0.0.1

### IDEA
Build an engine for generating 3D interactive Fiction games based on JSON inputs. 
Edit the json files in the Game folder and then use the preview and export buttons to export your adventure game.
Allow for customisation and export of games as a separate html / javascript bundle or an exe.
Possibly mobile support for exporting as APK /. AB file for android.
Multi-Platform support - Desktop, Mobile, VR and (Possibly) AR.

### Planned Features
* Component system for characters supporting custom models and associated avatar  
* Dialogue System with branching - Dialogue UI allowing for custom colours / texture etc
* Define 3D Scenes with character components and assets
* Create unique repayable games that the engine can generate based on easily editable JSON files
* Customise scenes with different colours textures, background elements etc

### Possible Features
* Further / optional - create interface for creating the branching narratives (similar to Twine) 

### Current Teck Stack
* Rendering / 3D - A-Frame
